<h2>Data</h2>

<h3>Administrative Data on Address Vacancies</h3>

United States Department of Housing and Urban Developmentâ€™s (HUD) Aggregated United States Postal Service (USPS) Administrative Data on Address Vacancies is the primary dataset for analysis and is used to measure net address growth. This data is collected by USPS postal workers to facilitate mail delivery, and provides quarterly counts of addresses serviced by USPS. These addresses are categorized by residential, business, and other. An address is considered vacant if delivery staff on urban routes have identified that mail has not been collected for 90 days or longer. Some addresses are consitered to be "no-stat" (neither occupied nor non-occupied) for many reasons, including (1) being on a rural route that has been vacant for 90 days or longer, (2) the address is for a structure under construction and is not yet occupied, (3) identified by a carrier as not likely to be active for some time.
